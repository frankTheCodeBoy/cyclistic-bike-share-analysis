# 🧪 Cyclistic Case Study Roadmap: PREPARE Phase

## 🧭 Guiding Questions

### 📍 Where is your data located?

The historical trip data for Cyclistic is publicly available and was downloaded
from the official source provided in the case study. It’s hosted by Motivate
International Inc.

### 🗂️ How is the data organized?

The data is structured into quarterly CSV files, each containing trip-level
details. These datasets can be analyzed individually or combined to represent
a full year. Each file includes fields such as ride type, start/end times,
station locations, and rider category (member vs. casual).

### ⚖️ Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?

Yes, the data passes the ROCCC test:

- **Reliable:** Provided by a reputable source (Motivate International Inc.)
- **Original:** Directly sourced from Cyclistic’s system
- **Comprehensive:** Covers a wide range of trip details across multiple quarters
- **Current:** Reflects recent usage patterns
- **Cited:** Properly licensed and attributed

### 🔐 How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?

The dataset excludes personally identifiable information (PII) to protect user
privacy. For example, it doesn’t include names, contact details, or payment
methods. This ensures compliance with data protection standards while
maintaining analytical value.

### 🔍 How did you verify the data’s integrity?

Initial verification was done through manual inspection:

- Checked for missing values and nulls
- Identified inconsistent data types
- Flagged any anomalies in timestamps or station names

This step ensures the dataset is clean enough for meaningful analysis.

### 📊 How does it help you answer your question?

The trip data provides behavioral insights into how different rider types use
Cyclistic bikes. By analyzing patterns such as ride duration, frequency, and
station usage, we can uncover distinctions between casual riders and annual
members—directly addressing the business question.

### ⚠️ Are there any problems with the data?

No major issues, but a few minor challenges include:

- Inconsistent data types across some columns
- Null values in station fields
- Occasional formatting irregularities

These are manageable through standard cleaning techniques.
